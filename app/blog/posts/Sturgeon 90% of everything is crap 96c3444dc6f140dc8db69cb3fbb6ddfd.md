# Sturgeon: 90% of everything is crap

Published: February 24, 2021

[Khao Niao](https://khao-niao.com/) serves the best Pad Thai I’ve ever had in my life. I’ve tried countless Pad Thai around the [Omaha Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha%E2%80%93Council_Bluffs_metropolitan_area) and in various cities when traveling—none come close. Khao Niao’s is the best. Maybe [Sturgeon agrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law).

This vibrating in my cheeks

Omaha is a train station of sorts.

Maybe like OKC in Sea of Tranquility.

Waiting here but not really.

Purposefully preparing

for something

for god

for who knows what

for who knows how long

and itâ€™s nice

this kind of waiting

being here

it could be this whole lifetime.

Or one more day

or 1,000 or 10,000

Omaha is my home base.

Perfect for reconnaissance

of how why what to be human

a training area of sorts.

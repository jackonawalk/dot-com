The storm has passed. Washed over me with her suddenness and isolation. Today's the day after and everything's covered in iceâ€”chunks everywhere like a snow globe exploded. But it's beautiful. The sun is shining, and it feels like it's coming thru with a new vigor. It glistens on the ice. Everywhere is glowing. I walk more slowly, but I love this (I usually hate this). I'm going to buy more bread today and when I walk there I'll see more ice and more sun. More joy. Godforbid joy comes. I can't stand her (I want to stan her).

From short-term decisions like takeout for dinner to long-term decisions like funding an investment portfolio, we decide to spend value on the immediate or on the long-haul. Value might mean money, time, or [will](https://jacksellwood.com/on-will/). Either way, it’s vital to choose intentionally. We’re either leveraging value right now or maximizing it for later.

Short-term decisions alter our moods, kick us into gear, and maintain homeostasis. These salves help us get through the day, but the value they use isn’t renewable.

Short-term value:

- Fast food, dessert, takeout
- Social media
- Caffeine
- Driving
- TV shows
- Doomscrolling
- Upgrading to the latest smartphone
- Sitting in traffic
- Meetings
- Fast fashion
- Venting to friends
- Moving around constantly

Long-term value:

- Learning to cook
- Gathering with friends
- Deep sleep
- Walking
- Movies, documentaries
- Reading
- Investing in hobbies
- Planning ahead
- Headspace for creative, strategic work
- Durable goods
- Finding a damn therapist
- Staying for a while

*This list obviously isn’t extensive: it’s simply meant to illustrate ideas for shifting from short-term value to long-term value activities. In fact, this is my list. Yours will, should, look different—reflecting your life and goals.*

While some short-term value spending is necessary, we can work to minimize it to make room for the future. Long-term activities bring a sense of security and build opportunity successively. They generate learning, enduring experiences, and help us build our internal compass—all of which we can share with others. This makes life a lot more interesting.

Much like the stock market, there will be missteps, mistakes, and the occasional regression. But in the spirit of Bob Ross, these [“happy little accidents”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw6odlNp7_8) are their own valuable, long-term activity. Learning to weather the storm of life and experiment means building the most enduring trait of all: self examination. Self examination leads us forward when we’re stuck, dissatisfied, or lost on where to go next.

Have faith for a moment and believe that this focus is worth it: life becomes fuller, more validating, and [aligned](https://jacksellwood.com/alignment-with-way-less-push/) with where we want to be. You could say, it pays dividends.

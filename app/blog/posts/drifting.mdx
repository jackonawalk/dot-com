This is a story about friends who fall out of being friends. Their friendship began out of circumstance mixed with pleasantness. Slightly more than neutral, they were good for each other. Time passed and seasonal occasions came and went. And soon other interests piqued them and they drifted. One day they reconnected and it felt odd. Like that shel silverstein about the boy who becomes an old man who can’t swing on the tree’s branches anymore. Suddenly they were slightly different people who didn’t need to connect. And so now, small talk doesn’t progress to big. Blinking at one another another they each thought what happened when did we become this. More than likely when did we unbecome what we were. How odd they thought this sort of ambivalence. Be quick but don’t hurry they thought.

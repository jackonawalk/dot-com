# Our lady of perpetual resistance

Published: May 7, 2023

I stood with resistance today. Well—I walked with resistance this morning. She told me my heart didn’t want to go forward. She told me to go back.

“But why, Resistance, ought we go back?” I replied.

“Because those are the golden days,” she wept.

“What’s wrong Resistance?”

“No, these golden days.” she said.

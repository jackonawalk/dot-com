1. **Workspaces:** Collections of apps and data within a pillar of context
2. **Apps:** units of capability that are defined by discrete, consistent records
3. **Records:** A medium to longterm container of fields and data
4. **Entries:** Short to medium term, highly unstructured data
5. **Views:** Structured ways to present records (and maybe entries)
6. **Schema:** Shared, global descriptions of common data practices
7. **Fields:** Highly structured data with defined parameters
8. **Relationships:** Containers that related to each other through specific values
9. **Filters:** Queries performed on a record set as defined by given fields
10. **Visualizations:** High-level non-linear summaries of larger data sets
11. **Calculations:** Mathematical queries/summaries of records
12. **Users:** People who are the subject of data or access
13. **Share:** Access thatâ€™s defined proactively or reactively as driven by context
14. **Annotations:** Human-driven value-added context
15. **Devices:** Physical hardware for accessing systems
16. **Navigation:** Way finding to traverse through contexts and views
17. **Messages:** Information that informs a user of an action
18. **Identity:** A way of federating a user as defined by data
19. **Interfaces:** Pointer modes for the system
20. **Evaluations:** Machine-driven observations
21. **Action:** Verbs that happen to data at a timestamp
22. **Code:** Instructions and language for a machine
23. **Machine:** A human-driven invention that executes code
24. **Context:** Channels of data as defined by the limits of cognition
25. **Human:** An organic, conscious, and dynamically driven machine

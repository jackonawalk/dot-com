Things have changed this year. Last spring, a few profound spiritual experiences shifted my view inwards towards my heart. As I unearth the knots that have been holding my heart in a self conscious arrest, I see more beauty and silliness. Throughout the year, coffee with various friends has acted as touchstones grounding my quest in their love and support.  What they don't tell you when you start wandering is that you begin to notice the world in greater detail, and this eventually translates inside too. We wrestle with thisâ€”reconciling the baggage weâ€™ve accumulated with our new appreciation for everything. This heightened clarity, both inside and out, softens us and opens our hearts. For me, I cry a lot more now, but itâ€™s worth it. ðŸ’›

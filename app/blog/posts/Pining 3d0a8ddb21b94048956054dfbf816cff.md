# Pining

Published: March 18, 2022

My heart pines.

For the future, the past, or this moment because it feels so good.

Anxious eagerness for what hasn’t come and what might arrive.

That feeling when the snow thaws and the sun wakes up.

New clothes, new you, and readiness for new patterns.

First day of school smells.

Not the first date but the second or third.

Walking the same path, noticing beauty, and hoping this all happens again.

The meniscus of a new chapter.

Crawling forward and dipping backward—just at the threshold.

Maybe a new to do list or notebook.

The start of something new.

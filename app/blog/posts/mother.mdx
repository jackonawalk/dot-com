Oh infinite mother

Goddess of creation

Destroyer of worlds

Help me heal and rest

Let me love and pleasure

In the center of my chest

Oh finite mother

Creature of nature

Looking out my window

Left me feel soft

Like the waters edge

No need to dive deep

There’s beauty already here

Mother of me

Mother within me

Beacon shine, beacon shine

Let out my own

Inner mother

The most loving and

Selfless

This is the way.

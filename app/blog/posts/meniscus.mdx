I sit here on the cusp of something.

The yearning for this eventuality grows so strong I can’t contain it.

I want to bubble up and tell everyone about it.

It’s so exciting it fixes everything and nothing all at once.

It comes from within at a moment not predicted.

Why now and not later?

After it’s expelled, it’s nothing where there used to be something.

Something escaped to nowhere and now its place, it’s old place, is empty. Where did it go?

Is it traveling or is it gone forever?

Hopefully it returns from pilgrimage.

Transiency is its goal. Fleeting is its purpose.

The cusp is the point of it.
